      # This is because dlopen doesn't respect LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is deleted by SIP-protected binaries.

      # 2. Then on macos/arm64 try /opt/homebrew/lib, since this is a typical standard directory.
      # FFI is often used together with homebrew, so that we hardcode the path for arm64 here.

      # 3. Then try typical system directories starting with the /local/ directory first.
      #
      # /usr/local/lib is used by homebrow on x86_64.
      # /opt/local/lib is used by MacPorts and Fink.
      # /usr/lib is there, because it was always there.

    # On Linux the library lookup paths are usually defined through /etc/ld.so.conf, which can be changed at will with root permissions.
    # Also LD_LIBRARY_PATH is respected by the dynamic loader, so that there's usually no need and no advantage to do a fallback handling.
    #
    # Windows has it's own library lookup logic, very different to what we do here.
